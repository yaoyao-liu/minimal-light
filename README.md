## Getting Started

This template can be used in the following two ways: 
- **Using with the GitHub Pages Service.** GitHub will provide you with a server to generate and host web pages.
- **Using locally with Jekyll.** You may install Jekyll on your own computer and generate static web pages (i.e., HTML files) with this template. After that, you may upload the HTML files to your server.

The detailed instructions are available below.


### Using with the GitHub Pages Service

There are two ways to use this template on GitHub:

#### Fork this repository
- Fork this repository (or [use this repository as a template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)) and change the name to `your-username.github.io`.

- Enable the GitHub pages for that repository following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site).

#### Using this repository as a remote theme
To use this theme, add the following to your repository's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: yaoyao-liu/minimal-light
```

Please note that adding the above line will directly apply all the default settings in this repository to yours.

If you hope to edit any files (e.g., `index.md`), you still need to copy them to your repository.

### Using Locally with Jekyll

First, install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The install instructions can be found here: <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides>

Then, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaoyao-liu/minimal-light.git
cd minimal-light
```
Install and run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle add webrick
bundle exec jekyll server
```
View the live page using `localhost`:
<http://localhost:4000>. You can get the HTML files in `_site` folder.

### Using the HTML version

The compiled HTML files are available in the `html_source_file` folder. If you don't like Jekyll, you may directly edit and use the HTML version.

## Customizing

### Configuration variables

The Minimal Light theme will respect the following variables, if set in your site's `_config.yml`:

  ```yaml
# Basic Information 
title: Your Name
position: Ph.D. Student
affiliation: Your Affiliation
email: yourname (at) example.edu

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

  ```
### Edit `index.md`

Create `index.md` and add your personal information. It supports **Markdown** and **HTML** syntax.

### Edit included files

There are two markdown files included in `index.md`. They are `_includes/publications.md` and `_includes/service.md`, respectively. These two files also support **Markdown** and **HTML** syntax. If you don't hope to include these two files, you may remove the following lines in `index.md`:
https://github.com/yaoyao-liu/minimal-light/blob/b38070cd0b6bce45d8a885f3828549af8f82b7cb/index.md?plain=1#L21-L23

If you hope to edit the publication list without changing the format, you may edit `_data/publications.yml`:
https://github.com/yaoyao-liu/minimal-light/blob/77b1b3b31d4561091bcd739f37a2e1880e8b5ca5/_data/publications.yml#L3-L11


### Stylesheet

If you'd like to add your own custom styles, you may edit `_sass/minimal-light.scss`.

### Layouts

If you'd like to change the theme's HTML layout, you may edit `_layout/homepage.html`.
